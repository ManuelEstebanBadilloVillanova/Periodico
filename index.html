                son: "Gotta walk the district."
                Ehrhardt and her opponent,
                Republican Eamest Leonard, have been
                pounding the pavement to introduce
                themselves to voters in a re-drawn
                District 107, which includes the north
                em half of Oak Lawn, sections of cen
                - tral and east Dallas, and a northern
                swath east of central expressway jutting
                up to the LBJ Freeway.
                Ehrhardt has picked up the endorse
                ment of the political action committee
                of Lesbian/Gay Political Coalition of
                Dallas Leonard received the endorse 
                ment of Log Cabin Republicans of 
                Dallas.
                The candidates get-out-the-vote
                efforts are kicking into high gear for 
                election day. With statistics and maps of
                every square inch of the district, it 
                seems, Erhardt plans to have an army 
                measur of about 30 "poll pushers" at voting 
                sites handing out pro-Ehrhardt litera 
                ture, in addition to running a phone 
                bank to remind people to vote and
                coordinate transportation to the polis.
                Ehrhardt said surprise its the most 
                common response she gets when 
                knocking on doors. Most people say 
                they have never met their representa 
                tive in the Texas Legislature before, a 
                situation which she said she finds frus-
                trating, given her efforts to get out in
                the district.
                Gay and lesbian issues will almost 
                certainly be featured in the 1997 legisla 
                gram tive session. The Lesbian/Gay Rights 
                Lobby of Texas plans to offer several 
                proposals, as well as to fight off expect 
                ed anti-gay bills:

                    Hate crimes. Both candidates for 
                    District 107 have pledged to support a 
                    hate crimes bill, which would stiffen 
                    criminal penalties for crimes motivated 
                    by religious, racial, or anti-gay preju 
                    dice. Leonard said he generally sup- 
                    ports anti-crime measures. Ehrhardt is 
                    widely credited with being a leader in 
                    last session's attempt to pass a revised 
                    hate crimes bill, which narrowly failed

                    Ehrhardt supports the civil rights bill, 
                    arguing that employment security is one of 
                    the most important social justice questions 
                    facing the community. Observers say such a 
                    bill has no chance of passing during the Texas 
                    Legislature's next session.</p>

                    Same-gender marriage, Leonard has said he would
                    vote for a bill ban- ning same-gender marriage 
                    in Texas He said he sees no need to expand the 
                    family code to provide state recognition for same-
                    gender unions. Ehrhardt opposes the measure, which 
                    is expected to be introduced by anti-gay conserva- 
                    tives Analysts expect a marriage bill forbidding same-
                    gender unions to pass during the next legislative session. 
                    The question, they say, is how much anti- gay language 
                    will be included in the measur.
